## Pre-training and Fine-tuning Tutorial for InternLM

To start a demo model training, you need to prepare three things: **installation**, **dataset preparation**, and **model training configuration**. In this guide, we will first cover the steps for dataset preparation and then briefly describe the model training configuration.

### Installation

Please refer to the [installation guide](./install.md) for instructions on how to install the necessary dependencies.

### Dataset Preparation (Pre-training)

The dataset for InternLM training consists of a series of `bin` and `meta` files. To generate the training dataset, you need to use the `tokenizer` tool to tokenize the raw text data. The tokenizer model can be imported by specifying the model path in the `tools/tokenizer.py` script. The current provided model is `V7.model`. If you want to use a different model, you can modify the model path directly in the `tokenizer.py` script.

You can generate the `bin` and `meta` files for your raw data by running the following command, where the `raw_data_name` parameter represents the name of your raw data file, `input_file_type` represents the format of your raw data file (currently supports `txt`, `json`, and `jsonl`), and `bin` represents the path to save the generated `bin` files.


```bash
$ python tools/tokenizer.py --raw_data_name your_raw_data_file_name(without suffix) --input_file_type 'text' or 'json' or 'jsonl' --bin your_output_bin_path
```

Here is an example of data processing (only the data processing example for the `txt` format is provided here, the data processing process for `json` and `jsonl` is exactly the same as for `txt`):

Given a file `raw_data.txt` containing the raw dataset, the raw dataset is shown below:

```bash
Appreciate every detail in life to truly taste the flavor of happiness.
Dreams are the source of lifeâ€™s motivation. Pursue them diligently to achieve your goals.
Learn to be tolerant and understanding to establish truly harmonious interpersonal relationships.
```

You can generate the `bin` and `meta` files by running the following command:

```bash
$ python tools/tokenizer.py --raw_data_name raw_data --input_file_type 'text' --bin cn/output.bin
```

It should be noted that the generated `bin` files need to be saved in one of the following directories: `cn`, `en`, `code`, `ja`, `ar`, or `kaoshi`, depending on the type of dataset.

Here, `cn` represents the Chinese dataset, `en` represents the English dataset, `code` represents the code dataset, `ja` represents the Japanese dataset, `ar` represents the Arabic dataset, and `kaoshi` represents the exam dataset.

The format of the generated `bin` files is as follows:

```python
{"tokens": [98655, 2317, 2922, 6649, 1595, 7856, 435, 2424, 442, 9556, 12807, 410, 17313, 446, 23331, 95746]}
{"tokens": [98655, 302, 1383, 269, 657, 410, 2687, 446, 2424, 98667, 269, 25220, 281, 523, 1874, 492, 1248, 38127, 4563, 442, 11227, 829, 8980, 95746]}
{"tokens": [98655, 24190, 442, 517, 15013, 649, 454, 8793, 442, 5849, 9556, 17917, 1369, 1084, 29890, 12021, 95746]}
```
Each line in the `bin` file corresponds to each sentence in the original dataset, representing the tokens of each sentence (referred to as sequence below).

The format of the generated `meta` file is as follows:

```bash
(0, 16), (110, 24), (262, 17)
```

Each tuple in the `meta` file represents the meta information of each `sequence`, where the first element in the tuple indicates the `starting index` of each `sequence` among all `sequences`, and the second element indicates the number of `tokens` for each `sequence`.

For example, the first `sequence` starts at index 0 and has 16 `tokens`. The second `sequence` starts at index 110 and has 24 `tokens`.

The `bin` and `meta` file formats for `json` and `jsonl` type files are the same as for `txt`, so we won't go over them here.

### Data Preparation (Fine-tuning)

The data format for fine-tuning tasks is the same as for pre-training tasks, which consists of a series of `bin` and `meta` files. Let's take the Alpaca dataset as an example to explain the data preparation process for fine-tuning.

1. Download the [Alpaca dataset](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/blob/main/alpaca_data.json).

2. Tokenize the Alpaca dataset using the following command:

```shell
python tools/alpaca_tokenizer.py /path/to/alpaca_dataset /path/to/output_dataset /path/to/tokenizer --split_ratio 0.1
```

It is recommended that users refer to alpaca_tokenizer.py to write new scripts to tokenize their own datasets

### Training Configuration

Taking the configuration file `configs/7B_sft.py` for the 7B demo as an example, let's discuss the data, model, and parallel configurations required to start a model training.

#### Data Configuration
Here are the key parameters and their explanations for data configuration:

```python
TRAIN_FOLDER = "/path/to/dataset"
SEQ_LEN = 2048
data = dict(
    seq_len=SEQ_LEN,  # Length of the data samples, default value is 2048
    micro_num=1,  # Number of micro_batches processed in one model parameter update, default value is 1
    micro_bsz=1,  # Packed_length = micro_bsz * SEQ_LEN, the size of data processed in one micro_batch, default value is 1
    total_steps=50000,  # Total number of steps to be executed, default value is 50000
    min_length=50,  # If the number of lines in the dataset file is less than 50, it will be discarded
    train_folder=TRAIN_FOLDER,  # Dataset file path, default value is None; if train_folder is empty, training will be done using randomly generated datasets
    pack_sample_into_one=False, # Logic for data arrangement, determines whether to calculate attention based on the seq_len dimension or the actual length of the sequence
)
```

<div align="left">
    <img src="../imgs/pack_into_one.png" width="550"/>
</div>


Currently, it supports passing the dataset file path `train_folder`, and the file format is required to be as follows:

```bash
- folder
    - code
        train_000.bin
        train_000.bin.meta
```

For detailed information about the dataset, please refer to the "Data Preparation" section.

#### Model Configuration

If you want to load a model checkpoint when starting the training, you can configure it as follows:

```python
SAVE_CKPT_FOLDER = "local:/path/to/save/ckpt"
MODEL_ONLY_FOLDER = "local:/path/to/load/init/model/ckpt"
LOAD_CKPT_FOLDER = "local:/path/to/load/resume/ckpt"
ckpt = dict(
    save_ckpt_folder=SAVE_CKPT_FOLDER,  # Path to save the model and optimizer checkpoints
    checkpoint_every=float("inf"),  # Save a checkpoint every specified number of steps, default value is inf
    load_model_only_folder=MODEL_ONLY_FOLDER,  # Path to load the initial model weights, only load model weights without loading optimizer weights, training will start from the first step
    load_ckpt_folder=LOAD_CKPT_FOLDER,  # Path to load the weights of the model and optimizer for resuming training, training will resume from the specified step
    load_optimizer=True,  # Whether to load optimizer weights when resuming training, default value is True
)
```

Note:
- `load_model_only_folder` and `load_ckpt_folder` cannot be set at the same time.
- If the path starts with `local:`, it means the file is stored in the local file system. If it starts with `boto3:`, it means the file is stored in the remote OSS.

The configuration for the model is as follows:

```python
model_type = "INTERNLM"  # Model type, default value is "INTERNLM", corresponding to the model structure initialization interface function
NUM_ATTENTION_HEAD = 32
VOCAB_SIZE = 103168
HIDDEN_SIZE = 4096
NUM_LAYER = 32
MLP_RATIO = 8 / 3
model = dict(
    checkpoint=False,
    num_attention_heads=NUM_ATTENTION_HEAD,
    embed_split_hidden=True,
    vocab_size=VOCAB_SIZE,
    embed_grad_scale=1,
    parallel_output=True,
    hidden_size=HIDDEN_SIZE,
    num_layers=NUM_LAYER,
    mlp_ratio=MLP_RATIO,
    apply_post_layer_norm=False,
    dtype="torch.bfloat16",
    norm_type="rmsnorm",
    layer_norm_epsilon=1e-5,
)
```

Note: Users can customize the model type name and model structure, and configure the corresponding model parameters. The model initialization function interface can be registered through the `MODEL_INITIALIZER` object in `utils/registry.py`. When initializing the model in the training main function `train.py`, the specified model initialization interface function can be obtained through the `model_type` configuration.

#### Parallel Configuration

Training parallel configuration example:

```python
parallel = dict(
    zero1=8,
    pipeline=1,
    tensor=1,
)
```

- zero1: zero parallel strategy, divided into the following three cases, default value is -1
  - When `size <= 0`, the size of the zero1 process group is equal to the size of the data parallel process group, so the optimizer state parameters will be split within the data parallel range.
  - When `size == 1`, zero1 is not used, and all data parallel groups retain the complete optimizer state parameters.
  - When `size > 1` and `size <= data_parallel_world_size`, the zero1 process group is a subset of the data parallel process group.
- pipeline: pipeline parallel size, currently only supports 1, default value is 1
- tensor: tensor parallel size, usually the number of GPUs per node, default value is 1

Note: `Data parallel size = Total number of GPUs / Pipeline parallel size / Tensor parallel size`

### Start Training

After completing the data preparation and relevant training configurations mentioned above, you can start the demo training. The following examples demonstrate how to start the training in both slurm and torch environments.

If you want to start distributed training on slurm with 16 GPUs across multiple nodes, use the following command:

```bash
$ srun -p internllm -N 2 -n 16 --ntasks-per-node=8 --gpus-per-task=1 python train.py --config ./configs/7B_sft.py
```

If you want to start distributed training on torch with 8 GPUs on a single node, use the following command:

```bash
$ torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc-per-node=8 train.py --config ./configs/7B_sft.py
```

### Training Results

Taking the configuration of the demo training on a single machine with 8 GPUs on slurm as an example, the training result log is shown below:
